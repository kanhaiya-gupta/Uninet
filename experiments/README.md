## How to Use

Each experiment directory contains:
1. `config.py` - Configuration parameters
2. `model.py` - Model architecture
3. `train.py` - Training script
4. `evaluate.py` - Evaluation script
5. `utils.py` - Utility functions
6. `README.md` - Experiment-specific documentation

To run an experiment:
1. Navigate to the specific experiment directory
2. Configure the parameters in `config.py`
3. Run the training script: `python train.py`
4. Evaluate the model: `python evaluate.py`

## Best Practices
1. Keep experiments modular and reusable
2. Document all parameters and configurations
3. Include evaluation metrics and visualization
4. Save model checkpoints and results
5. Use version control for experiment tracking
